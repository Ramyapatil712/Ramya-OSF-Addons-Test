Low Cost Management Practices to Detect and Control Sub-Clinical Mastitis in Dairy Cattle\

\
Sub clinical mastitis is a hidden form of mastitis, causes a huge economical loss to the\
farmers. So, present study was done with the aim to find out such management practice to\
detect and control sub-clinical mastitis in the dairy cattle under field condition that can\
easily be adopted by the farmers. Eighty cattle having sub clinical mastitis were selected\
by Surf Field Mastitis Test (SFMT) and divided into two groups i.e., control (N=40) and\
treatment (N=40). Tri sodium citrate @ 30 mg/kg body wt. was supplemented to the cows\
orally till 10 days in the treatment group. Milk sample was collected at 0 and after 10 day\
of the experimental period and analysed for somatic cell count (SCC), milk pH, electrical\
conductivity (EC), milk yield (kg), fat, SNF, protein and lactose %. It was found that\
recovered rate from SCM, milk yield, fat, SNF, protein and lactose were high and SFMT\
score, milk SCC, pH and EC were low in the treatment group of the cows. Hence,\
detection of SCM through SFMT and control by use of tri-sodium citrate is an effective,\
easy and cost-effective management practices which will support the farmers in raising\
their income through increase in milk quality and quantity.\
